# The Terminal Application

If you are on windows environment as I am, you are going to need a terminal application that will connect with the Cluster (the master node in the cluster to be specific)

For this, there are many applications but I've been using putty for long time and I would suggest to use PuTTY.

to download PuTTY, go to the following website. 

https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

and download the following two applications (64 or 32 bit as per your OS)
- putty.exe (The terminal app to connect to the AWS cluster)
- puttygen.exe (Convert the PEM file downloaded from AWS to the ppk file which can be used by putty.exe)
