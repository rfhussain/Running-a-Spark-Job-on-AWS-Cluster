# The Data Science Perspective 
As a data scientist or a one going to be a data scientist, you must be able to think like one. 
Most importantly the following

- Why we are doing that
- How we will do it
- Where we will perform the job 

And many more questions, a data scientist should have to frame the problem into a data science problem. 

In this scenario, let's suppose that there's a viewer coming to a movie website and watches a movie. What he can possibly do?
He can obviously search for a movie by Genre, an Action movie or a Fiction movie etc. 

He/She watches the movie, and that's it. But what after that. 

The website would want him to come and watch more movies, but this time according to his previus selection and preferences, he must be given a list of choices of simillar movies (off course we can do it by Genre), but we are not going to flood him with a huge number of movies (say fiction) etc. 

What we are going to actually do is, we will give him a list of Top-10 movies which are nearest to the movie he watched. 

Here, our job as a data science professional comes into the picture. We are going to use the historical data, analyze it and present him with the list of movies which were watched by other people who had earlier watch this movie, which he/she recently finished. 

We are also going to account for the ratings given by the users to movies simillar to the movie he had watched. 

Based on all that, we will compile a list of top-10 similar movies to him and it is more likely that he would take interest in the list we've presented them, based on the historical data we had available. 

### Some Real Life Examples

We have example of Netflix, when we watch a movie, Netflix suggests us similar movies to watch

Similarly, we've example of Linked in, if you visit someone's profile, what Linked-in does is that it gives us a section where it says "People who've visited this profile, have also visited the following profiles" 

All this has some underlying historical data and some sort of data analytics is getting performed and hence we are getting the relevent results, which increase our chances of getting the customer buy-in.

Let's move to the next step now.
